# Hello world

This is my first post on my current home for writing on the web.

My main goal at this point is to track my deep learning/generalized data science "journey." Seems 
like it would be nice to have a tangible record of how career related things progress.

For now, my main career interest is building data products. I'm specifically interested in products 
that optimize decision making.

Of course, there are far more interesting things to write about, and I may attempt to do so at some point. 
But I'll spare you my political convictions for now.
